In the current era of advanced technology, patient data such as name, personal information, and ailment condition are highly insecure and frequently violated. Patients' Electronic Health Records (EHR) are easily accessible to unauthorized external parties and are easily accessed by hackers. This results in an imbalance between data accessibility and security. This is something that blockchain technology can help with.
Our project, Medical Report Management & Distribution System on Blockchain, is designed to secure medical reports and provide a safe way of accessing the clinical data of patients for their caretakers and doctors using cryptography and decentralization.
The proposed system also maintains the balance between data accessibility and security. The proposed framework helps doctors, patients and caretakers to securely store and access patientsâ€™ medical data in EHR.
